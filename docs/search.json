    "text": "3.2 Week 2 Learning Diary: Portfolio Tools\n\n3.2.1 Summary of weekly task\nThis week focused on learning how to create and manage an online learning portfolio using Quarto and xaringan. The main task was to build a structured Quarto website and produce a short presentation in Markdown format, embedding the slides directly into the weekly notebook.\n\n\n3.2.2 What I learned\nThrough working with xaringan, I learned how presentation slides can be created using R Markdown rather than traditional slide software. This approach integrates text, figures and explanations into a single, reproducible workflow, making it easier to update and maintain presentation content over time.\nUsing Quarto to organise weekly notebooks helped me understand the importance of project structure, file organisation and relative paths when building a multi-week portfolio. Embedding the slides into the Week 2 page highlighted how different outputs can be combined into a coherent and public-facing learning record.\n\n\n3.2.3 Reflection\nThis week shifted my perspective from producing isolated files to thinking in terms of a reusable and extensible workflow. Although working with Quarto and xaringan initially required more effort than familiar tools, the approach offers clear advantages for documenting learning processes and maintaining transparency. I expect this structure to become increasingly valuable in later weeks, when more complex practical work needs to be clearly communicated and archived.",

It also clarified the difference between raw satellite data and processed visual outputs.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Applications\nThe practical work showed how remote sensing can support real-world analysis by revealing patterns that are not visible from ground-level observation. Using a single spectral band demonstrated how reflectance values vary across surfaces. For example, water areas appear very dark in the red band because water absorbs most of the incoming radiation, while snow and bare rock appear bright due to high reflectance.\n\nRed band reflectance highlighting contrast between water, vegetation, and snow-covered terrain.\nCombining multiple bands into an RGB composite improved visual clarity. Vegetated areas became easier to identify, and the spatial structure of coastlines and islands was clearer. This type of visualisation is useful for mapping, landscape interpretation, and comparison across regions.\n\nRGB composite enhancing land cover contrast.\nThese methods are relevant for environmental monitoring, urban studies, and land-cover mapping. They show how satellite data can support decision-making by providing consistent spatial information over large areas.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Reflection\nThis week changed how I think about images in general. I used to see satellite images as similar to aerial photos, but I now understand that they are data products shaped by sensor design and processing choices. The same place can look very different depending on which bands are used and how they are combined.\nI also realised that visual interpretation alone has limits. While RGB images are intuitive, they do not directly measure environmental conditions. This highlighted the importance of indices and quantitative approaches, which will become more important later in the course.\nThe practical tasks helped connect theory to actual data, but they also showed that careful interpretation is needed. Colours can be misleading if their meaning is not understood. This week made me more cautious and more critical when reading satellite imagery.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Extended Reflection: From Visualisation to Analysis\nA key takeaway from this week was the difference between visual appearance and analytical value. Visual products are helpful for orientation and communication, but they are only the first step. For example, vegetation may look green in an RGB image, but this does not directly describe its condition or density.\n\nNDVI map showing vegetation distribution across the study area.\nThe introduction of NDVI showed how combining bands mathematically can produce more meaningful information. Unlike RGB images, NDVI provides a clearer link to physical surface properties. This helped me understand why remote sensing is widely used in environmental and urban analysis.\nThis week laid the groundwork for later practical work. It showed that learning remote sensing is not only about tools, but also about thinking carefully about what the data represents and what questions it can realistically answer.",
